# Data Analysis Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains **Data Analysis Projects**.  
Among the tasks that were completed in projects:
1. Data processing and cleaning
2. Working with outliers and duplicates
3. Statistical data analysis
4. Economic analysis
5. Machine learning
6. Data visualization

## Tools

**Jupyter Notebook** is used for data analysis.  
Main packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn and statsmodels.  
**SQL** is used for data preparation, building marts and economic analysis.  
**Power BI** is used for data visualization data, using **Power Query** and **DAX**.  
All though there are plenty of graphs for analysis purposes in **Python** scripts, final data is presented in BI system, as it has prettier graphs and user-friendly instruments.  
The results of the proposed project are presented in PDF format.
